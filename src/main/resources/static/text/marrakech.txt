The museum is housed in the Dar Menebhi Palace, constructed at the end of the 19th century by Mehdi Menebhi. 
The palace was carefully renovated by the Omar Benjelloun Foundation and converted into a museum in 1997. 
The house itself represents an example of classical Moorish architecture, with fountains in the central courtyard, traditional seating areas, a hammam and intricate tilework and carvings. 
The museum's large atrium was originally a courtyard, and is now covered in glass and fabric.
