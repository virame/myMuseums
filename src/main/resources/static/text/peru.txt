The first selection of the art works that'd belong to the museum's permanent collection was in charged of Mario Vannini Parenti. 
That's how he acquired a collection of more than 200 original art works, including sculptures, paintings, drawings, prints and ceramics. 
So, in the museum, the art of all Italian regions is represented. 
Most of the collection is from the beginnings of the 20th Century, although avant garde movement is not present.
