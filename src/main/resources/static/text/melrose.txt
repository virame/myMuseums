Melrose House played an important role during the Anglo-Boer Wars. 
In June 1900 British troops invaded Pretoria and requisitioned Melrose House to use as their war offices.  For 18 months, the war effort against the Boers was strategised from 275 Jacob Mare Street. 
The Peace Treaty of Vereeniging that ended the war was signed around the massive dining table at Melrose House on 31 May 1902.
