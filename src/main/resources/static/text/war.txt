The Australian War Memorial is Australia's national memorial to the members of its armed forces and supporting organisations who have died or participated in wars involving the Commonwealth of Australia, and some conflicts involving personnel from the Australian colonies prior to Federation. 
The memorial includes an extensive national military museum. 
The Australian War Memorial was opened in 1941, and is widely regarded as one of the most significant memorials of its type in the world.
