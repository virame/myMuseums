Holding one of the Yucatn's most important collections of Maya artifacts, this modern museum is a welcome sight in a city known more for its party scene than cultural attractions. 
On display are some 400 pieces found at key sites in and around the peninsula, ranging from sculptures to ceramics and jewelry. 
One of the three halls shows temporary Maya-themed exhibits.
