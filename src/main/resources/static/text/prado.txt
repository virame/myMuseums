The Prado Museum is Madrid's top cultural sight, and one of the world's greatest art galleries. 
Located in the eponymous street, El Paseo del Prado, its dazzling display of works by the great European masters such as Velazquez, Goya, Raphael, Rubens, and Bosch (among other major Italian and Flemish artists), 
is housed in an 18th-century Neo-Classical building that opened as a museum in 1819.
