Chile`s National Fine Arts Museum is a building of imposing architecture sitting just accross the beautiful Parque Forestal in Santiago Downtown area. 
The museum was initially created for the dissemination of art that began to flourish in the country in mid/late nineteenth century, when its artworks began to be gathered. 
Since 1880 most of these very paintings, portraits and sculptures have been housed in different buildings; until, finally, in 1990, the current Palace of Fine Arts was established as the definite home of an art collection that began with 140 pieces and now boasts over 5,000 (not all of them are on display).
