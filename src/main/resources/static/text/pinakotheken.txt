Museums are not crowded, come with the headphones included in the price, are easily accessible via the tram from the HauptBahnHof area, and have a wonderful variety of art dating from the Renaissance through today. 
The ticket for all three can be purchased at the box office of any of the three, and then you can begin your walk through Western art history.
