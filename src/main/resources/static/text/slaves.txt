The House of Slaves itself is now a museum. 
An evocative structure complete with iron shackles and dingy cells where the slaves were said to have been crushed together in horrifying darkness, awaiting their inescapable fate. 
The historical controversy aside, the site`s power as a grim testament to one of our species darkest eras has garnered visits from such luminaries as Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama.
