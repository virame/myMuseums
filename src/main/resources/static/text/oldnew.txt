The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) is located just outside of Hobart, Tasmania. 
It was opened in 2011 by David Walsh, a Hobart local, whose professional gambling career lead to an amassed collection of art. 
This collection ranges from large scale contemporary installations to ancient ceramics, with the over arching theme of sex and death. Recent temporary exhibitions (The Red Queen, 2014, On the Origins of Art, 2017) have focused on the meaning and purpose of art in society.
